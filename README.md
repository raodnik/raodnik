Hi, I’m DurgaRaoN

  I’m someone who is passionate about Computational Engineering, Machine Learning and structural dynamics.

  Currently I am working as a subsea engineer and my main focus is on analysing the dynamic response of riser and flowline.Also I leverage my knowledge to analyse the structural behaviour of subsea oil nd gas field equipment. I'm a post graduate in Ocean Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. 
  
  My main driver is Matlab, but I'm also proficient in Python and C++.
  
  Check out my project below:
  
  [Fluid Structure Interaction](https://github.com/raodnik/Term-paper-OE5450) - Numerical modelling of near-shore wave propagation in the presence of breakwater using Mild Slope Equation as governing Equation.
